Use of freshwater resources,,"In general, renewable water is abundant in Europe. However, signals from long-term climate and hydrological assessments, including on population dynamics, indicate that there was a 24 % decrease in renewable water resources per capita across Europe between 1960 and 2010, particularly in southern Europe.    The densely populated river basins in different parts of Europe, which correspond to 11 % of the total area of Europe, continue to be hotspots for water stress conditions, and, in the summer of 2014, there were 86 million inhabitants in these areas.   Around 40 % of the inhabitants in the Mediterranean region lived under water stress conditions in the summer of 2014.   Groundwater resources and rivers continue to be affected by overexploitation in many parts of Europe, especially in the western and eastern European basins.   A positive development is that water abstraction decreased by around 7 % between 2002 and 2014.   Agriculture is still the main pressure on renewable water resources. In the spring of 2014, this sector used 66 % of the total water used in Europe. Around 80 % of total water abstraction for agriculture occurred in the Mediterranean region.  The total irrigated area in southern Europe increased by 12 % between 2002 and 2014, but the total harvested agricultural production decreased by 36 % in the same period in this region.   On average, water supply for households per capita is around 102 L/person per day in Europe, which means that there is 'no water stress'. However, water scarcity conditions created by population growth and urbanisation, including tourism, have particularly affected small Mediterranean islands and highly populated areas in recent years.   Because of the huge volumes of water abstracted for hydropower and cooling, the hydromorphology and natural hydrological regimes of rivers and lakes continue to be altered.   The targets set in the water scarcity roadmap, as well as the key objectives of the Seventh Environment Action Programme in the context of water quantity, were not achieved in Europe for the years 2002–2014.",2017-03-22T14:53:26Z,2017-03-22T18:17:14Z,,"Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Switzerland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Liechtenstein,Luxembourg,Austria,Cyprus,Romania,Malta,Albania,Bulgaria,Turkey,Estonia,Iceland,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Kosovo (UNSCR 1244/99),France,Czech Republic,Hungary,Norway,Montenegro,Germany,Netherlands,Greece,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Serbia,Lithuania,Belgium,Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",published,Water,http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/use-of-freshwater-resources-2/assessment-2,Indicator assessment,"2003,2005,2007,1991,2009,1994,1992,1998,2010,2000,2012,1996,2002,2014,2004,2006,1990,2008,1995,1993,1999,2011,2001,2013,1997",application/pdf,European Environment Agency (EEA),en

Final energy consumption by sector and fuel,,"Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption decreased by 11 % (1.3 % annually) in the EU-28. Final energy consumption decreased in all sectors, particularly in the industry and households sectors (16.5 % and 14.8 %, respectively), but also in the transport (4.5 %) and services sectors (1.7 %). This decrease in final energy consumption since 2005 was influenced by economic performance, structural changes in various end-use sectors, particularly industry, improvements in end-use efficiency and lower than average heat consumption as a result of favorable climatic conditions, particularly in 2011 and 2014. In 2014, the EU-28 met its 2020 target for final energy consumption.       Between 2005 and 2014, final energy consumption in some non-EU EEA countries, namely Turkey, Iceland and Norway, increased by 28 % (2.8 % per year). This difference was caused by an increase in energy consumption in Turkey (35 %) and Iceland (78 %), and a small decrease in energy consumption in Norway (1 %). Since 1990, the final energy consumption in these non-EU EEA countries has increased by 92 % (2.8 % annually).       Final energy consumption in the EEA-33 countries decreased by 8.4 % (1 % annually) between 2005 and 2014.

By way of contrast, the share of electricity generated from renewable sources is growing rapidly and reached more than one quarter of all gross electricity generation in the EU-28 (29 %  in 2014  ), more than twice as much as in 1990. As such, renewable sources generated more electricity in 2014 than nuclear sources or coal and lignite.    Nuclear energy sources contributed roughly one quarter of all gross electricity generation in 2014 (27.5 %).          Final electricity consumption (the total consumption of electricity by all end-use sectors plus electricity imports and minus exports) has increased by 25 % in the EU-28 since 1990, at an average rate of around 0.9 % per year (see ENER 016). In the EU-28, the strongest growth was observed in the services sector (2.5 % per year), followed by households (1.1 % per year).

The EU has steadily increased the contribution of renewable energy sources to gross final energy consumption thanks to dedicated national support schemes and significant cost reductions achieved by some renewable energy technologies. This trend continued in 2014, although the pace of progress was slightly reduced by cuts in feed-in tariffs in some Member States and deteriorating market conditions due to the persistent economic downturn in others. Analysis of the EU Member States’ renewable energy action plans shows that if they follow their plans, the EU 2020 renewables target will be achieved.

Environmental and labour taxation,,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) calls for a shift in taxes from labour towards pollution and resource use as a means of helping to achieve environmental objectives and stimulating employment and green growth. Taxes on labour remain eight times higher than environmental taxes in the EU. These relative shares in overall taxes have changed very little over the last decade and only five EU countries have decreased their shares of labour taxes while increasing their shares of environmental taxes. The main reasons for this lack of progress appear to be a combination of the political difficulty of making any changes to a country’s tax system, along with the real and perceived economic and social challenges regarding environmental taxes. Research and analysis suggest that, in order for it to be successful, this type of fiscal reform requires careful planning to avoid any negative economic and social impacts and widespread consultation that reflects good governance principles. There are no current indications from Member States that they intend to shift taxes from labour towards the environment, so the outlook for 2020 appears negative.</p>",2016-12-09T08:00:00Z,2017-04-12T13:56:18Z,,"Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Cyprus,Czech Republic,Austria,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,France,Hungary,Netherlands,Germany,Greece,Belgium,Lithuania,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Finland,Italy",published,Policy instruments,http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/environmental-and-labour-taxation,Briefing (all),"2014,2003,2004,2015,2016,2005,2017,2006,2018,2007,2019,2008,2009,2020,2010,2011,2000,2012,2001,2013,2002",application/pdf,European Environment Agency (EEA),en
Outdoor air quality in urban areas,,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) includes the objective of ensuring that outdoor air quality in the EU has significantly improved by 2020, moving closer to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Observing the existing EU air quality legislation standards is a chief milestone in this respect. Despite some improvements, due to the implementation of EU legislation on emissions of air pollutants and air quality, key EU air quality standards for the protection of human health — concentrations of particulate matter (PM), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) — are currently not being met in various air quality monitoring stations in the EU. This is particularly true for urban areas, where more than 70 % of the EU population lives. This can be mainly attributed to the high level of emissions from road traffic and residential combustion in urban areas and unfavourable conditions for the dispersion of emissions due to topography and meteorological issues. Based on current trends and because of their high and widespread exceedances in urban areas, it is unlikely that the air quality standards for these pollutants will be met by 2020, while achieving air quality in line with the WHO guidelines is much further away.

Resource efficiency,,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) includes the objective that by 2020 resource efficiency has to improve. Increasing resource efficiency can lower environmental burdens by reducing the overall consumption of materials and other resources, while helping to sustain economic development by securing the supply of resources and investments in innovation. Resource productivity — economic output per unit of material used — provides a proxy for resource efficiency. Between 2000 and 2015, resource productivity in the EU increased by 35 %. Most of this increase occurred after 2008. The increase since 2008 has mostly resulted from reduced activity in the material-intensive industries of manufacturing and construction, which are sectors strongly affected by the economic downturn.

However, because other drivers and pressures influencing both water demand and freshwater availability (e.g. consequences of climate change, increasing population and rapid urbanisation) are expected to intensify, it remains uncertain whether or not water stress can be prevented or significantly reduced. It is therefore important that water abstraction respects available renewable resource limits in order to prevent or significantly reduce water stress.</p>",2016-12-09T08:00:00Z,2017-04-11T11:24:29Z,,"Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Austria,Cyprus,Czech Republic,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Hungary,France,Germany,Netherlands,Greece,Lithuania,Belgium,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Finland,Italy",published,Water,http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/freshwater-use,Briefing (all),"2003,2014,2015,2004,2005,2016,2017,2006,2007,2018,2019,2008,2009,2020,2010,2000,2011,2012,2001,2002,2013",application/pdf,European Environment Agency (EEA),en
Energy efficiency,,"<p>The Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) requires that the EU meet its energy efficiency target of reducing primary energy consumption by 20 % by 2020 (compared with a business-as-usual scenario). Energy consumption (both primary and final) has decreased over the last decade at a rate that, if continued, means that the target will be met. In fact, the EU as a whole has already met its target in final energy consumption. In 2014, final energy consumption in the EU was 1 062 Mtoe (million tonnes of oil equivalent), which was already below the EU target for 2020 (1 086 Mtoe). Together with progress in implementing energy efficiency policies, the economic downturn, structural changes in industry, lower consumption in the transport sector and a warmer climate have contributed to this development. In 2014, the sum of all 2020 targets for primary energy consumption from 28 Member States amounted to 1 526 Mtoe, which was 3 % higher than the EU target (1 483 Mtoe). As economic growth returns, more intensive efforts will be necessary to implement energy efficiency policies at the national level to ensure that the 2020 target is met.</p>",2016-12-09T08:00:00Z,2017-03-10T10:11:59Z,,"Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Cyprus,Austria,Czech Republic,Romania,Malta,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Hungary,France,Germany,Netherlands,Greece,Lithuania,Belgium,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Finland,Italy",published,Energy,http://www.eea.europa.eu/airs/2016/resource-efficiency-and-low-carbon-economy/energy-efficiency,Briefing (all),"2014,2003,2015,2004,2016,2005,2006,2017,2018,2007,2019,2008,2009,2020,2010,2000,2011,2001,2012,2013,2002",application/pdf,European Environment Agency (EEA),en

Exceedance of air quality limit values in urban areas,,"Air quality in Europe is slowly improving. However, between 2000 and 2014, a significant proportion of the urban population in the EU-28 was exposed to concentrations of certain air pollutants above the EU limit or target values. The numbers of people exposed were even higher in relation to the more stringent World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guideline values set for the protection of human health.        For fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), 8 - 17 % of the urban population were exposed to concentrations in excess of the EU target value, while 85 - 97 % were exposed to concentrations above the WHO guideline value (for 2006-2014 only).   For particulate matter (PM 10 ), the respective exposure estimates were 16 - 42% for the EU limit value and 50 - 92 % for the WHO guideline value.   For ozone (O 3 ), estimates was 8 - 55 % for the EU target value and 94 - 99 % for the WHO guideline value.   For nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), estimates were 7 - 31 % in both cases (EU limit value and WHO guideline).   For benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), estimates were 17 - 24 % for the EU target value and 81 - 91 % for the estimated reference level (for 2008-2014 only).",2016-10-26T12:38:45Z,2016-10-26T12:39:42Z,,"Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Austria,Cyprus,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,France,Czech Republic,Hungary,Greece,Netherlands,Germany,Lithuania,Belgium,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",published,Air pollution,http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/exceedance-of-air-quality-limit-3/assessment-2,Indicator assessment,"2003,2014,2004,2005,2006,2007,2008,2009,2010,2011,2000,2012,2001,2002,2013",application/pdf,European Environment Agency (EEA),en

Urban sprawl in Europe - joint EEA-FOEN report,,"This report provides a comparable measurement of urban sprawl for 32 European countries at three levels (the country level, the NUTS-2 region level and the 1-km2 cell level) and for two years (2006 and 2009). The analysis is based on the Copernicus system which monitors the Earth and collects data by different sources. This data provides information about a number of thematic areas, including land. Under land a pan-European component delivers information about various areas, including the level of sealed soil (imperviousness), through high resolution layers taken from satellite imagery. The analysis uses new urban sprawl metrics taking into account the way built-up areas are laid out and how they are used. It also looks at the factors which contribute to an increase or decrease in urban sprawl. The results confirm the conclusions of earlier EEA reports namely that in many parts of Europe current levels of urban sprawl have contributed to detrimental ecological, economic and social effects. This gives cause for concern and such effects may increase alongside planned urban development.",2016-06-08T10:00:00Z,2017-02-20T16:23:07Z,,"Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Switzerland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Liechtenstein,Luxembourg,Cyprus,Austria,Romania,Malta,Bulgaria,Estonia,Iceland,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Czech Republic,France,Hungary,Norway,Germany,Netherlands,Greece,Belgium,Lithuania,Croatia,Slovakia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",published,"Land use,Sustainability transitions",http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/urban-sprawl-in-europe,Publication / Report,"2006,2009",application/pdf,European Environment Agency (EEA),en

Fossil fuels (gas, solid fuels and oil) accounted for 73.8% of the total gross inland energy consumption in 2013 (83% in 1990), while renewables accounted for just 11.8%. Between 1990 and 2013, the share of fossil fuels in the total gross inland energy consumption of the EU-28 decreased at an annual rate of 0.4% per year (0.6% per year between 2005 and 2013).     The efficiency of conventional thermal power plants has also improved from 42.2% in 1990 to 48% in 2013. In 2013, only 72.3% of the total gross inland energy consumption in the EU-28 reached the end users. Between 1990 and 2013, energy losses in transformation and distribution were about 27.7% of total gross inland energy consumption and did not show a significant trend.         The EU-28 is increasingly relying on imported fossil fuels from non-EU countries. The share of net imported fossil fuels in total gross inland energy consumption increased from 44% in 1990 to 53.2% in 2013. The EU’s dependence on imports of fossil fuels from non-EU countries remained relatively stable between 2005 and 2013. In 2013, 58% of total net imports was oil, 28% gas and 14% solid fuels.",2015-12-04T09:13:10Z,2017-01-16T17:58:29Z,,"Sweden,Latvia,Poland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Luxembourg,Cyprus,Austria,Romania,Malta,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Hungary,Czech Republic,France,Greece,Netherlands,Germany,Belgium,Lithuania,Slovakia,Croatia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",published,Energy,http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/overview-of-the-european-energy-system-3/assessment,Indicator assessment,"2013,2005,1990",application/pdf,European Environment Agency (EEA),en

Energy intensity,,"Between 1990 and 2013, energy intensity (the ratio of gross inland energy consumption and GDP)  decreased by 1.7% per year in the EU28 countries and by 1.6% per year in the EEA countries. In 2013, energy intensity was 32% below the 1990 level in the EU28 and 30% below in the EEA countries.   During this period, the rate of decrease of energy intensity in the EU28 has been rather constant. The period 1990-2005 is characterised by relatively high economic growth and the more modest growth of gross inland energy consumption. The period 2005-2013 is characterised by much smaller economic growth and decreasing gross inland energy consumption. The resulting rate of decrease of energy intensity is rather similar in these periods.     All EEA member countries  [1]  show a decrease of energy intensity between 2005 and 2013, except for Norway (annually +1.6%), Estonia (+0.3%) and Turkey (annually +0.3%). The largest decreases were observed in central European countries (e.g. Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia) because of changes in their economic structure.

These are three core aspects of the EU's main marine policy instrument — the Marine Strategy Framework Directive — and relate to the condition of marine ecosystems and the human drivers of ecosystem change. This assessment also involves identifying the main sustainability challenges affecting our seas, and how the EU is responding to these challenges. Ultimately, the report argues that EU is not on the path to fulfil its ambition of achieving sustainable use of its seas; although it is fully empowered to do so through the current array of policies and knowledge.

Renewable energy in gross inland energy consumption,,"The share of renewable energy sources in gross inland energy consumption (GIEC) increased in the EU28 from 4.3% in 1990 to 11.0% in 2012 [1] . In 2012, the main contributors to the gross inland consumption of renewable energy were biomass and renewable waste (58%), followed by hydro (16%), wind (10%) and liquid biofuels (9%). The gross inland energy consumption from renewable sources increased at an average annual rate of 4.4% over the period 1990-2012, with a faster growth rate observed since 2005 (6.7%/year). In non-EU EEA countries [2]  the share of renewable in gross inland energy consumption reached 20% in 2012.

Please note that the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption (GFEC) is presented in another indicator (see  ENER28 ). In contrast to GIEC, GFEC excludes transformation losses in the energy sector.      [2]  Non-EU EEA countries are Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.

Emission intensity of agriculture  in Europe,,"Nitrogen emission to water: Absolute decoupling of nitrogen emissions from GVA is observed in seven countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia ). This means that these countries succeeded in economy growth while reducing emissions to water. As the area of agriculture land remained constant during the analyzed period, the decrease in emission can be attributed to decrease in specific gross nutrient balance per hectare.   Relative decoupling was observed in the Czech Republic, and Poland. This means that the resource efficiency has increased, however with higher absolute emissions.  Decreases in emissions coupled with a decrease in GVA occurred in 11 countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom). In six out of those 11 countries, the rate of emission decrease was greater than the rate of the GVA decrease.     Phosphorus emission to water: Absolute decoupling of phosphorus emissions from the GVA is observed in five countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, and Slovenia). Decrease in emission coupled with decrease in GVA occurred in ten countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom). In all these countries except Denmark, the rate of emission decrease was greater than the rate of the decrease of GVA.   The ranges of nutrient emission intensity of agriculture are quite wide and reflect varieties of agriculture practices across European countries.   Values of nitrogen emission intensity for 2008 range from 6,0 to 176 tons of total nitrogen per million EUR GVA per year. Significant decrease in nitrogen emission intensity between 2000 and 2008 was recorded in Bulgaria, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In 2008 Bulgaria, Portugal and Romania reported (in Eurostat) the lowest values of the specific nitrogen balance per hectare. In creased emission intensity was observed in Denmark, Ireland and United Kingdom, however, this was due to a falling GVA not to emissions, which actually were reduced. Calculation of emission intensity based on GVA diminished by subsidies, which reflects better the actual economic performance from  agriculture, result in much higher emission intensities for countries, e.g.,  Norway, Finland , Lithuania and Poland with relatively high contributions from subsidies to the economy.. The increment in emission intensity associated with excluding subsidies is significant namely in Norway (106 t/mio EUR/y) and Finland (38,8 t/mio EUR/y).   The 2008 values for total phosphorus emission intensity range from 0,47 to 13,03 tons per million EUR GVA per year. Significant decrease in the phosphorus emission intensity (decrease by more than 50%) over the last decade was recorded in nine countries (Austria, Belgium, Czech republic, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Slovenia). Moreover, Austria, Germany, France, Luxembourg and Portugal, reported (Eurostat) the lowest values of the specific phosphorus balance per hectare comparable to the EU-27 average, being 1 kg of total phosphorus per hectare per year. The impact of subsidies on phosphorus emission intensity (based on 2008 data), was most significant in Norway and Finland, where the increment in emission intensity associated with excluding subsidies accounted for 16,24 and 3,49 t/mio EUR/y respectively , whereas the increment in remaining countries did not exceed 1 t/mio EUR/y.   Subsidies: The analysis of subsidies on the output of the agricultural industry for the studied years showed that 13 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Slovenia and the United Kingdom) reduced the proportion of subsidies in relation to the GVA of their agricultural sector between 2000 and 2008. On the other hand, 5 countries (Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) increased this proportion during the same period. Information was incomplete for Bulgaria and Germany, where subsidy levels for years 2000 and 2008 respectively were reported as zero (Eurostat). Noteworthy is the sharp increase in the proportion of subsidies as part of GVA  (being in the range between 12-26 % of GVA) in new Member States like Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia accompanied by the increase of GVA values. And, on the other hand, the significant reductions in old Member States like Denmark, Luxembourg, Sweden and the United Kingdom.   Given the multiple factors that affect both the change in sectoral GVA and in nutrient balance, it is complicated to draw direct relationships between these two variables. Some key descriptors which could aid in explaining the behavior of these are the structure of the sector (e.g. farm size, standard gross margins, crop type, stocking rate), the socioeconomic characteristics of the area (e.g. rural population, income and employment levels) and the policy measures in place (e.g. subsidies). However, it must be noted that the specific context of each country could result in varying combinations of the mentioned factors and their aggregate effects.        ",2014-02-24T09:45:00Z,2015-09-04T19:00:09Z,,"Sweden,Poland,Ireland,Denmark,Luxembourg,Cyprus,Austria,Malta,Romania,Bulgaria,Estonia,Slovenia,United Kingdom,Hungary,France,Czech Republic,Norway,Greece,Netherlands,Germany,Belgium,Lithuania,Slovakia,Portugal,Italy,Finland",published,"Agriculture,Water",http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/untitled-indemission-intensity-of-agriculture/assessment,Indicator assessment,"2000,2008",application/pdf,European Environment Agency (EEA),en

European catchments and Rivers network system (Ecrins),,"Version 1, Jun. 2012 - Ecrins is acronym for European catchments and Rivers network system. It is a geographical information system of the European hydrographical systems with a full topological information. Ecrins is a composite system made from the CCM developed by the JRC, Corine land Cover, WFD reporting elements, etc.  It is organised from a layer of 181,071 “functional elementary catchments (FECs)” which average size is ~62 km2, fully connected with explicit identifier (ID) relationships and upstream area. Catchments are grouped as sub-basins, river basin districts (actual and functional to meet hydrographical continuity).  The catchments are as well organised according to their sea shore of emptying to meet Marine Strategy delineations. Catchments are drained by 1,348,163 river segments, sorted as “main drains” (connecting together the FECs) and secondary drains (internal to a FEC). river segments mimic the natural drainage, however fulfilling the topological constraint of “0,1 or 2 upstreams, single or 0 downstream”. Each segment is populated with distance to the sea, to ease further processing. They are connected to elementary catchments and nodes documented with altitude.  Segments are as well documented with a “dummy river code”, fully populated that earmark each segment with the most distant to the outlet in each drainage basin and, everywhere this has been possible, with a “true river” ID based on river naming.  A layer of lakes and dams has been elaborated. Lakes polygons (70,847) are taken from Corine Land cover , WFD Art. 13 and in some cases, from CCM “water layer”. Lakes inlets and outlets are set with the segment ID and where relevant, the dams making the lake is documented. All lakes which depths and volume was found have been updated.  Version 1.0 here presented still contain some topological errors (e.g. incorrect segment branching), because inaccurate geometry. They are noted and a correction procedure is underway.",2012-06-13T14:55:00Z,2017-03-22T15:37:18Z,Europe,"Sweden,Russian Federation,Andorra,Ukraine,Switzerland,Ireland,Spain,Denmark,Liechtenstein,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Cyprus,Romania,Malta,Albania,Monaco,United Kingdom,Kosovo (UNSCR 1244/99),France,Hungary,Georgia,Norway,Montenegro,Moldova,Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the,Germany,Greece,Belarus,Netherlands,Slovakia,Finland,Latvia,Poland,Luxembourg,Austria,Bulgaria,Turkey,Estonia,Iceland,Slovenia,Czech Republic,San Marino,Serbia,Belgium,Lithuania,Kazakhstan,Croatia,Portugal,Italy",published,Water,http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/european-catchments-and-rivers-network,Data (at EEA),"2003,2004,2005,2006,1990,1991,1994,1995,1992,1993,1998,2000,1999,2001,1996,2002,1997",text/html,European Environment Agency (EEA),en
